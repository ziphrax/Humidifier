# ProjectBaseName

## Quickstart

In this quickstart we will build, test, deploy and destroy a simple lambda stack.

Step 1: Build the solution:

```ps
dotnet build .\ProjectBaseName.sln
```

Step 2: Run the unit tests:

```ps
dotnet test .\src\ProjectBaseName.Tests
```

You should see xunits console test runner output:

```ps
Build started, please wait...
Build completed.

Test run for C:\dev\ProjectBaseName\ProjectBaseName\src\ProjectBaseName.Tests\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.0\ProjectBaseName.Tests.dll(.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.0)

Total tests: 1. Passed: 1. Failed: 0. Skipped: 0.
Test Run Successful.
Test execution time: 1.7203 Seconds
```

Step 3: Change directory to the deploy tool folder:

```ps
cd .\src\ProjectBaseName.DeployTool
```

Step 4: Deploy the **base** infrastructure stack:

This will provision a deployments bucket that will have code and cloudformation templates uploaded to it.

```ps
dotnet run deploy-base --env=$env$
```
Wait for the cloudformation to provision the stack. If successful you should see `CREATE_COMPLETE` in the output.

Step 5: Deploy the **simple** lambda stack.

This will package the lambda function code and associated cloudformation template and upload it to the deployments bucket. It will then kick off the cloudformation deployment.

```ps
dotnet run deploy-simple --env=$env$
```

Wait for cloudformation to provision the stack. Again, if successful you should see `CREATE_COMPLETE` in the output.

Step 6: Invoke the **simple** lambda

```ps
dotnet run invoke-simple --env=$env$
```

You should see output similar to this:

```ps
[11:58:48 INF] Invoking lambda with args: {"Name": "ProjectBaseName", "$type": "SimpleFunctionArgs"}
[11:58:52 INF] Logs:

[11:58:52 INF] Lambda result: {"Message": "Hello, ProjectBaseName", "$type": "SimpleFunctionResult"}
[11:58:52 INF] Exit: 0
```

The first time the function runs Lambda has to 'coldstart' so it takes longer to run. Run the function again, it should take less than 100 ms.

Step 7: Destroy the **simple** stack

This will delete the simple cloudformation stack.

```ps
dotnet run destroy-simple --env=test
```

Step 8: Destroy the **base** stack

This will empty the deployment bucket, and then delete the base cloudformation stack.

```ps
dotnet run destroy-base --env=test
```

## Using the DeployTool

Build the deploy tool, and move it into a folder called `deploy`.

```ps
dotnet build .\src\ProjectBaseName.DeployTool\ --output $pwd\deploy
```

Change to the deploy folder
```ps
cd .\deploy
```

Run the tool with no command line args

```ps
dotnet .\ProjectBaseName.DeployTool.dll
```

It should print the following usage:

```ps
Usage: ProjectBaseName.DeployTool [options] [command]

Options:
  -?|-h|--help  Show help information

Commands:
  deploy-base
  deploy-simple
  destroy-base
  destroy-simple
  invoke-simple
  secrets-decrypt
  secrets-encrypt
  secrets-upload

Use "ProjectBaseName.DeployTool [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

You can get help for each command by adding `--help`. For example:

```ps
dotnet .\ProjectBaseName.DeployTool.dll deploy-simple --help
```

It should print help for the `deploy-simple` command:

```ps
Usage: ProjectBaseName.DeployTool deploy-simple [options]

Options:
  --env         environment
  -?|-h|--help  Show help information

```
